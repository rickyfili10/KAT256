# How this work?
KAT256 is a password reader that encrypts your passwords so that they are unreadable by humans and computers without having the password entered at the beginning.
### Part of the code was also used in the "Mojito" project

# Customizable
You can put a maximum number of password tries that you can use, if you get them all wrong, the program will block you for a certain number of seconds. It will not work even if you try to close and open it again. Just edit settings.py.
